## jQuery Slidestep plugin

jQuery Slidestep is an alternative slider/stepper to the normally used [jQuery UI slider](http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/).
In addition to support the standard behaviours/options of a slider it also supports the following:

* Specifying non-distributed values.
* Slide on click, move the handle to the point clicked on the slider.
* Magnetize, snap the handle to the nearest value on the slider when dragging.
* Automatically takes into account the width of the handle as part of the area used for the slider (can be toggled off).
* Debug options such as grid/log to make development and testing easier.
